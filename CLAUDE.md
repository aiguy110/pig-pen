# Pig Dice Game Rules

## Objective
Make as much money as possible by reaching the highest score.

## Gameplay
Each player takes turns rolling 2 dice. During a turn, a player continues until one of these occurs:

1. **Hold**: Player decides to stop and lock in their current score
2. **Roll a 7**: Score resets to whatever it was at the beginning of their turn
3. **Snake eyes (1,1)**: Score resets to 0
4. **Three doubles in a row**: Score resets to 0
5. **Score hits exactly 100**: Score resets to 0

**Special rule**: If a player rolls doubles, they MUST roll again.

## End Game
- Once a player reaches a score greater than 100 and decides to stop, each other player gets one final turn to overtake the leader
- Players who successfully overtake continue participating
- Players who fail to overtake within one turn are sidelined with their final score
- Each time a new leader emerges, remaining players must overtake within one turn or be sidelined
- Game ends when only one player remains (with the highest score)

## Scoring
At game end, everyone pays the winner $1 for each point behind the winner they are. Players with a score of 0 pay double.
